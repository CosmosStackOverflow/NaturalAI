# Automatic adaptation for any mocked world

Memory + Randomness + simple good/bad localized calculation rule can build a natural human brain.
Neural networks are faster when finding solutions for something, but it's not natural.
We will build NATURAL ai that fiat all the models and it should solve very complex problems.

Quiver blockchain network will be participate in the complex problem calculation and each node of quiver blockchain is a brain.
